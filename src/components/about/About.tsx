                I was a student at Rochester Institute of Technology with a BS in Computer Science. And I absolutely love to build, be it projects, contraptions, or even Legos. I am passionate about learning more and developing robust and inpactful solutions to problems. 
                <br />
                <br />
                I've had opportunities to work on various projects from full stack development to machine learning, and I am always looking to learn more.
